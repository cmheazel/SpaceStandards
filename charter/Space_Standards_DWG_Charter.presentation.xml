<p id="_dbf4d8ea-97bc-5527-d5da-84818266a11c">There is no common concept of “Space Standards”. The Space domain is composed of a wide collection of initiatives, each addressing one part of the whole. Each of these initiatives is developing their own standards and conventions. Attempts to harmonize across these initiatives is limited.</p>

<p id="_098afaf6-3691-c9c5-62d9-3ec1200ddc40">While the OGC cannot solve this problem for all disciplines, it can make sure that the concepts of space and time are consistent and interoperable across all communities in the Space domain. In addition, we can identify emerging Space domain standards which would impact our existing OGC Standards and encourage the impacted SWGs and DWGs to take appropriate action.</p>
